# Getting Started with Users list app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
## Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/rahul1368/opika-frontend`

Then run following command:
`cd opika-frontend`

Now run this command:

`npm install`

This will install all the dependenciens that are required.

## `npm setup`

This will insert 2 dummy users to the database

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This page will loads the users list and renders all the users (received from backend api).
I have not implemented pagination on frontend, but pagination is supported from backend side.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
App is ready to be deployed!
